# code-refacor-homework

This project is assigned to me as a homework. The website "Horisen's" code working is fine. But the code is not followed in a semantics way.

## The code I have done in sematics way is as follows:
Firstly I looked at the website, and by looking the website I have observed there is Header and Navigation need to be mentioned. and then the a href of "search engine optimization is not working".
Secondly I have put the main heading and under the main heading there is 3 sections.
Thirdly, I used aside tags in regards to Horisen Website which is shown in aside in the website.
There is no image alt in image tags. I put alt in all image tags.
Lastly, I put the footer tags.

Credits:
# Our Instructor Ben Atkinson. He shows us how to put an image screenshot in Readme file and follow up the process in Github.
# Our TA Yun Zhao. He helps us to provide the resources for semantics code.
# To all other students of this course who gave me information in regards to github.
